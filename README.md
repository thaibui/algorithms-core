It's simply a place for algorithms to live. A list of algorithms in this project
is provided below.

The project also includes tests and micro benchmarks for comparisions.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Mergesort

A generic implementation of mergesort algorithm in Java to sort data in a
single machine (DONE, needs BENCHMARK), with multiple threads (TODO) and 
in a distributed environment (TODO).
