It's simply a place for algorithms to live. A list of algorithms in this project
is provided below.

The project also includes tests and micro benchmarks for comparisions.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Mergesort

A generic implementation of mergesort algorithm in Java to sort data in a
single machine, with multiple threads (TODO) and in a distributed environment (TODO).  

## Benchmarks

A comprehensive list of benchmarks and the results is provided below. All the benchmarks
are done on a Macbook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, late 2013) using JMH v1.11.3.
